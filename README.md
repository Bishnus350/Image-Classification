# Image-Classification
I used a Machine Learning algorithm for image classification by clustering. Especially, I used K-means clustering.
# Why Image classification?
This is data data-intensive era. We have got data and hence the image. We are getting many images from satellites, rovers, telescopes, etc. 
Image classification and clustering on the basis of similarities and differences is one of the important things needed to study landscapes, study about diseases, classifications of breeds of dogs, and cats, and many more.
Human eyes have some limitations. We can easily distinguish between a dog and a cat. But if we have massive data then we might feel tired. Our judgments may be biased. 
# Computer Vision
It is a part of ML/AI that gives an eye to the computer to see and make a decision on the basis of training and testing or on the basis of instructions.
